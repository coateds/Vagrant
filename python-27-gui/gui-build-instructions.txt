vagrant up with the Vagrantfile and cookbook included
I usually comment out the `vb.gui = true` command in Vagrantfile, 
but not sure it is necessary to do so

when complete, vagrant halt
In gui, add cd rom
vagrant up
mnt cd rom and run sh script

turn gui on in Vagrant file and reboot/reload

turn on clipboard, etc
